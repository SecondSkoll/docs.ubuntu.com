# Ubuntu documentation service

[![CircleCI build status](https://circleci.com/gh/canonical-web-and-design/docs.ubuntu.com.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/canonical-web-and-design/docs.ubuntu.com)
[![Code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/canonical-web-and-design/docs.ubuntu.com/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/canonical-web-and-design/docs.ubuntu.com)

A central platform for hosting Ubuntu's various documentation portals.

## Local development

### Dependencies

First [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download). Linux users may need to add their user to the `docker` group.

### Run the local development server

To run the site locally:

``` bash
./run # Download containers, run the dev server and watch for sass changes
```

The first time this will take along time as it downloads and builds the documentation.

Now visit <http://127.0.0.1:8007>.

To see what other `./run` commands are available, run `./run usage`.

# Deploy
You can find the deployment config in the deploy folder.
